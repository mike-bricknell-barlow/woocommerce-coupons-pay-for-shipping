Allow woocommerce coupons to pay for customers shipping too!

== Description ==

When coupons amount total is greater than the cart total, woocommerce by default does not allow coupons to pay for the shipping. For example, if cart subtotal is $200 and shipping cost is calculated to $10. Now buyer applies a coupon of total $210 of value. In woocommerce, only $200 coupon amount will count and the buyer still has to pay for his/her shipping. Few shop owners may like to allow coupons to pay for the buyers shipping cost too (if applicable). This plugin will allow shop owners to active that feature.
